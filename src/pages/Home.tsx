      <h1>Digitization strategies for developing countries</h1>
      <p>
        Many developing countries struggle with setting the correct priorities when it comes to developing strategies
        for the deployment of IT. However, as digital systems now permeate all walks of life, expanding and improving
        them are crucial for catching up to developed nations.
      </p>
      <p>
        This platform is aimed at officials and citizens of developing countries that wish to help create a concrete
        strategy plan to improve the situation of their digital infrastructure.
      </p>
      <p>It has 3 major sections:</p>
      <p>
        - The analysis section provides facts about individual countries, which help the user to find a country
        comparable to their own.
      </p>
      <p>
        - The strategy section allows confirmed country officials to create a strategy plan for their country and
        regular users to view the created strategy plans.
      </p>
      <p>
        - The discussion section allows everybody to discuss individual measures and strategies and how they might be
        modified to better fit any given country.

        The whole process of the platform is governed by the IT-Boards of the individual countries. The IT-Boards
